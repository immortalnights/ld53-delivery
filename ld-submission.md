# Summary
Simple space delivery game in Unity.

# Objective
Complete delivery contracts between the space stations.

Arriving at a space station with excessive speed will incurs a penalty, paid in credits. To avoid the penalty arrive when the speed indicator is _green_.

(Incomplete) It was intended that each contract would have a deadline, to encourage fast delivery but that didn't make it in time.

# End-game
Arriving at a station which has no available contracts will end the game. A game summary will display (though, the stats aren't complete).

# Controls
* Left click to Accelerate
* Right click to Break

# HUD

## Credits
Earned by completing contracts. Spent on space station penalty charges.

## Fuel
Accelerating or Breaking uses fuel. Unfortunately this has no real affect.

## Speed
Accelerating increases speed. Conversely breaking decreases speed.
